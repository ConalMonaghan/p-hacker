						Several DVs are generated which correlate r = .2 to each other (assuming that they roughly tap into the same phenomenon). DV_all is the mean of all DVs. The DVs are drawn from a multivariate normal distribution with mean=0 and SD=1. A standardized mean difference is imposed between groups on each DV corresponding to slider value "True effect (Cohen's d)".  A t-test for independent groups is performed on each DV.
